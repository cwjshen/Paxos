In my solution, I use recursive calls to iterate through the input string 
	and build an output string. Each time an 'X' is encountered, two recursive
	calls are made to account for both a 1 or a 0.

Each X in the string represents two additional states that the string could have. 
	There should be 2^n total possible string outputs where n is the number of X's.
	Thus runtime is O(2^n)
